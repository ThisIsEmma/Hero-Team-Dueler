## Title:  

SuperHero-Team-Dueler Project

## Description:

The goal of this project is to practice object oriented programming concepts. Based on the tutorial available in this [repo](https://github.com/Tech-at-DU/Superhero-Team-Dueler/tree/master/P00-Object-Oriented-Programming)

## Language Used:

Python.

## Disclaimer

The tutorial recommended some variable to be called 'name', however I changed to 'something_name' instead (for example: 'hero_name', 'ability_name', etc), as using the keyword 'name' produced errors when running the code. Pytests have been adjusted accordingly.
